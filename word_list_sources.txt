Some other long stays, but that will keep it under 10 hours. (less than the 17 hours originally there)

Open Source Word Lists
Every couple years I find myself in need of a(n English) word list, either by frequency or alphabetical order or part of speech or some other generic but useful factor.

Am I missing something? Are there easily navigable and comprehensive open source lists like this out there already? Would people in NLP/Language Tech find these useful, or is it just me? I know you can buy some for a few hundred bucks, and various dictionaries have lists divided into several pages. There are at least a dozen uncomprehensive lists on like language learning websites and such.

As an example: https://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp?s=yYou can get a list of the top 5000 words by frequency here for free, but the longer lists are a decent amount of money.

Ideally it would be lists that are reasonable easy for a basic text processing algorithm to process.

A lot of the for purchase lists also include things like collocation data or genre of the source document, which is understandably gonna be more expensive to generate, but I don't really care about those things so much.

Am I being unreasonable in wishing such a thing was available for free online?

Agreed. The Google n-gram model is so vast, it's useless. Who wants to download hundreds of terabytes just to get basic word lists? And yes, a BYU professor sells the data and keeps the money. Nice.

Here's my list:

for a dictionary style set of words w/PoS and features use this: https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg/blob/master/src/main/resources/default-lexicon.xml

if you need even more word features, use:

https://lsg3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lexicon/current/web/release/2018.html

For word frequency, try:

https://github.com/ps-kostikov/english-word-frequency/blob/master/data/frequency_list.txt

or,

Enjoy!!!

This is a subset of an ngram language model, and ngram language models trained on (counted from) large corpora are widely available.

For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ngram_Viewer includes also unigram (single word) data, and this data can be obtained in various ways - for example, from here http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html

On the other hand, if you want more information than just frequencies, there are many public lexical resources, among them https://www.wiktionary.org/ , http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/ , etc.

Have tried looking at the Chatscript "FACT" or "DICT" files. Maybe you could parse those files into something you can use.

https://github.com/ChatScript/ChatScript/tree/master/DICT  Really good.
