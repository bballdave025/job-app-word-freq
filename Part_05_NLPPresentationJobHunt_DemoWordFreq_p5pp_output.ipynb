It's nice to have when you'd like to play with code and see better the outputs that come from running that code. I've had some problems with images going down, but I'm going to work to keep this one up.\n\nThe link to the online, interactive notebook - the binder - is at the badge you see right here\n\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bballdave025/job-app-word-freq/polished-5part-presented?labpath=Part_04_NLPPresentationJobHunt_DemoWordFreq.ipynb)\n\n<hr/>\n\n## We are calling this version 0.1.003\n\nIt's the FamilySearch CJKV jobs applied for in August 2023, but we're splitting it into smaller notebooks.
