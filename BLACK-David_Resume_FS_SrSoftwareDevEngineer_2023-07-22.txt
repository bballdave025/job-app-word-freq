Python, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Red Hat Linux®
	» Taught other members of the team to use Cygwin® as a first Linux-type implementation; 
Debugging & adapting package builds & software. || bash, C, C++, make, CMake, Perl
	» Automated scoring || wrote Python wrapper for text alignment (dynamic programming) 
& scoring executables written mostly in C, C++, & Perl
	» Normalization of different human & machine transcribers' output so as to have only 
words as pronounced & to allow comparison of different possible speech representations of 
the textual transcript ||  regexes & customized algorithms
	» Developed, distributed, & maintained said normalization for several teams having different 
use cases over three years' of use; included bug fixes || Python setuptools, pip, Azure Git
	» Communicated with management about & performed pass-offs to engineering of the 
normalization software  || C#, Microsoft Visual Studio, & Azure DevOps
	» Performed dataset management for purchased, open-source, & created datasets || bash

	» For the creation & curation of new datasets, used customized hardware. Also used robust & 
scalable call-recording software – implemented by a German freelancer whom I oversaw & 
with whom I worked || Python, Twilio, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, AWS NoSQL 
» Led a project to score & analyze transcribers - human as well as machine. Focused on performance differences when transcribing for the underrepresented & legally protected. Ensured appropriate control of content & lexicon. Shared findings with groups & legislators such that they successfully lobbied for the groups before-mentioned.
	» Iterative break testing for changes in the normalization software; used my NLP & 
programming experience to create robust & automated testing material
	» Solved the majority of file encoding & decoding issues for text & audio files
	» Attended conferences & research team meetings to stay up-to-date on emerging 
technologies & industry trends
	» Mentored new employees
